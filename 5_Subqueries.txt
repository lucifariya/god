| 6 | Find out the branch name and branch city, in which “ABHIJIT MISHRA” has an account. |
| 7 | Create a table named ACCOUNT_TYPE from ACCOUNT table with two columns ACCOUNT_NO and TYPE without data. |
| 8 | Insert into ACCOUNT_TYPE those accounts with balance < 50000. |
| 9 | Update ACCOUNT_TYPE set TYPE='FD' where CUST_NO = 'C0007'. |
| 10 | Delete from ACCOUNT_TYPE where balance < 20000. |
| 11 | Find account_no with balance greater than SOME of FD accounts. |
| 12 | Find account_no with balance greater than ALL of FD accounts. |
| 13 | Display details of branches where some loans are taken (EXISTS). |
| 14 | Display loan details where no installment is paid (NOT EXISTS). |
| 15 | Increase balances using CASE: >80000 → 6%, else 5%. |

### **Solutions**
```sql
-- 1
SELECT NAME, PHONE_NO, CUST_NO
FROM CUSTOMER
WHERE CUST_NO = (SELECT CUST_NO FROM DEPOSITOR WHERE ACCOUNT_NO = 'A0004');

-- 2
SELECT NAME FROM CUSTOMER
WHERE CUST_NO NOT IN (SELECT CUST_NO FROM LOAN);

-- 3
SELECT ACCOUNT_NO, BALANCE FROM ACCOUNT
WHERE ACCOUNT_NO IN (
    SELECT ACCOUNT_NO FROM DEPOSITOR WHERE CUST_NO = 'C0010'
);

-- 4
SELECT BRANCH_CITY FROM BRANCH
WHERE BRANCH_CODE = (
    SELECT BRANCH_CODE FROM LOAN
    WHERE CUST_NO = (SELECT CUST_NO FROM CUSTOMER WHERE NAME = 'ASLESHA TIWARI')
);

-- 5
SELECT I.*
FROM INSTALLMENT I
WHERE LOAN_NO IN (
    SELECT L.LOAN_NO FROM LOAN L
    WHERE L.CUST_NO = (SELECT CUST_NO FROM CUSTOMER WHERE NAME = 'ANKITA SINGH')
);

-- 6
SELECT B.BRANCH_NAME, B.BRANCH_CITY
FROM BRANCH B
WHERE B.BRANCH_CODE IN (
    SELECT A.BRANCH_CODE FROM ACCOUNT A
    WHERE A.ACCOUNT_NO IN (
        SELECT D.ACCOUNT_NO FROM DEPOSITOR D
        WHERE D.CUST_NO = (SELECT CUST_NO FROM CUSTOMER WHERE NAME = 'ABHIJIT MISHRA')
    )
);

-- 7
CREATE TABLE ACCOUNT_TYPE AS
SELECT ACCOUNT_NO, TYPE FROM ACCOUNT WHERE 1=0;

-- 8
INSERT INTO ACCOUNT_TYPE (ACCOUNT_NO, TYPE)
SELECT ACCOUNT_NO, TYPE FROM ACCOUNT WHERE BALANCE < 50000;

-- 9
UPDATE ACCOUNT_TYPE
SET TYPE = 'FD'
WHERE ACCOUNT_NO IN (
    SELECT ACCOUNT_NO FROM DEPOSITOR WHERE CUST_NO = 'C0007'
);

-- 10
DELETE FROM ACCOUNT_TYPE
WHERE ACCOUNT_NO IN (
    SELECT ACCOUNT_NO FROM ACCOUNT WHERE BALANCE < 20000
);

-- 11
SELECT ACCOUNT_NO FROM ACCOUNT
WHERE BALANCE > SOME (
    SELECT BALANCE FROM ACCOUNT WHERE TYPE = 'FD'
);

-- 12
SELECT ACCOUNT_NO FROM ACCOUNT
WHERE BALANCE > ALL (
    SELECT BALANCE FROM ACCOUNT WHERE TYPE = 'FD'
);

-- 13
SELECT * FROM BRANCH B
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM LOAN L WHERE L.BRANCH_CODE = B.BRANCH_CODE
);

-- 14
SELECT * FROM LOAN L
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM INSTALLMENT I WHERE I.LOAN_NO = L.LOAN_NO
);

-- 15
UPDATE ACCOUNT
SET BALANCE = BALANCE * CASE
    WHEN BALANCE > 80000 THEN 1.06
    ELSE 1.05
