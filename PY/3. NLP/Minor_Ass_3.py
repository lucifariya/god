# # MINOR ASSIGNMENT - 3: NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
# ### Question 1
# Define Natural Language Processing (NLP). Provide three real-world applications of NLP and explain how they impact society.

# **Solution:**  
# Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.  
#   
# Three real-world applications of NLP:  
# 1. **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants** (e.g., Siri, Alexa) - Enhances customer service.  
# 2. **Sentiment Analysis** - Helps businesses analyze customer feedback.  
# 3. **Machine Translation** (e.g., Google Translate) - Bridges language barriers.

# ### Question 2
# Explain the following terms and their significance in NLP:
# - **Tokenization:** Breaks down text into individual units (tokens) like words or phrases. This is the initial step for most NLP tasks, providing the basic building blocks for analysis.
# - **Stemming:** Reduces words to their root form by removing suffixes, using rules. This simplifies words but may not always produce valid words. It's computationally efficient.
# - **Lemmatization:** Reduces words to their dictionary base form (lemma), considering context and meaning. This provides accurate base words, improving accuracy in tasks needing semantic understanding, but is more computationally intensive.   

# ### Question 3
# What is Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging? Discuss its importance with an example.

# **Solution:**
# POS tagging assigns grammatical labels (noun, verb, etc.) to words in a sentence. It's crucial for:  
#   
# - Disambiguation: Resolving word meaning ambiguity.  
# - Syntactic analysis: Understanding sentence structure.  
# - Information extraction: Identifying key information.  
# - Machine translation: Ensuring accurate translation.
# 
# **Example:**  
# Sentence 
# "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog  ."

# ### Question 4
# Create a TextBlob named `exercise_blob` containing 'This is a TextBlob'

# In[3]:


from textblob import TextBlob
exercise_blob = TextBlob("This is a TextBlob")
print(exercise_blob)


# ### Question 5
# Write a Python script to perform the following tasks on the given text:
# - Tokenize the text into words and sentences.
# - Perform stemming and lemmatization using NLTK or SpaCy.
# - Remove stop words from the text.
# 
# Sample Text:
# "Natural Language Processing enables machines to understand and process human languages. It is a fascinating field with numerous applications, such as chatbots and language translation."

# In[5]:


from textblob import Word , TextBlob

Text=TextBlob("Natural Language Processing enable machines to understand and process human language. It is a fascinating field with numerous applications , such as chartboats and language translation.")
print(Text)
print(Text.words)
print(Text.sentences)

token2 = Text.words
for w in token2:
    print(w,":", w.stem())
print()
for w in token2:
    print(w,":", w.lemmatize())
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
stop = stopwords.words("english")
text_s = [i for i in token2 if i[0] not in stop]
print(text_s)


# ### Question 6
# Web Scraping with the Requests and Beautiful Soup Libraries:
# - Use the **requests** library to download the www.python.org home pageâ€™s content.
# - Use the **Beautiful Soup library** to extract only the text from the page.
# - Eliminate the stop words in the resulting text, then use the wordcloud module to create a word cloud based on the text.

# In[6]:


import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from wordcloud import WordCloud
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

url = "https://www.python.org"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
text = soup.get_text(separator=" ", strip=True).lower()
words = [w for w in word_tokenize(text) if w.isalnum() and w not in stopwords.words("english")]
wordcloud = WordCloud().generate(" ".join(words))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()


# ### Question 7
# (**Tokenizing Text and Noun Phrases**) Using the text from the previous problem, create a TextBlob, then tokenize it into Sentences and Words, and extract its noun phrases.

blob = TextBlob(text)

# ### Question 8
# (**Sentiment of a News Article**) Using the techniques in problem no. 5, download a web page for a current news article and create a TextBlob. Display the sentiment for the entire TextBlob and for each Sentence.

    print(f"  Sentence: {sentence}")
    print(f"    Polarity: {sentence.sentiment.polarity}")
    print(f"    Subjectivity: {sentence.sentiment.subjectivity}")


# ### Question 9
# (**Sentiment of a News Article with the NaiveBayesAnalyzer**) Repeat the previous exercise but use the NaiveBayesAnalyzer for sentiment analysis.

m = {wd: TextBlob(wd).correct() for wd in w[:200] if wd.lower() != TextBlob(wd).correct().lower()}
